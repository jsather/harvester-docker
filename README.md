Browser-based harvesting environment using ROS and Gazebo on a Google Compute Engine Instance. For a video summary of the full project, click [here](https://youtu.be/C6hrCVv2B-o).

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running using Google Compute Engine.

### Instance Setup
Create an instance with Ubuntu 16.04 with at least 1 GPU and attach a persistent disk. It is recommended to use a boot disk of at least 50GB and a persistent disk of at least 100GB. My setup is shown below:

### Firewalls
Set up firewalls for VNC, noVNC, and NFS.

### Installing
Clone the repo into your GCE instance.
```
git clone https://github.com/jsather/harvester.git
```
Download the relevant CUDA runtine and dev packages from the [NVIDIA developer site](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/machine-learning/repos/ubuntu1604/x86_64/), and place into project. 
```
mkdir -p harvester/docker_setup/harvester_project_build/cuda
mv libcudnn7_7.2.1.38-1+cuda9.0_amd64.deb harvester/docker_setup/harvester_project_build/cuda/
mv libcudnn7-dev_7.2.1.38-1+cuda9.0_amd64.deb harvester/docker_setup/harvester_project_build/cuda/
```
Run the preinstall script.
```
cd harvester/docker_setup/
sudo ./preinstall.sh
```
Configure [create_nfs_volume.sh](harvester/docker_setup/setup_host/create_nfs_volume.sh) to set up nfs between your development machine and GCE instance. Set the global variables `SERVER_IP`, `SERVER_DIR`, and `DEST` in the file header. 
```
# Example
SERVER_IP=141.126.89.186
SERVER_DIR=/home/jonathon/projects/harvester/harvester_instance
DEST=/mnt/disks/nfs 
```
Build the Docker container. This will take 30-60 minutes.
```
cd harvester
sudo ./build.sh
```
Start the Docker container to run your browser-based GUI.
```
cd harvester
sudo ./run.sh
```
Navigate to XX.XXX.XX.XXX:40001/vnc.html?host=XX.XXX.XX.XXX&port=40001, substituting your instance's external IP address.

## Running the Simulated Environment
Open the terminal in the browser-based gui and build the catkin environment.
```
cd /root/catkin_ws
catkin build
source devel/setup.bash
```
Run harvester_test.launch to spawn arm and randomly generated plant.
``` 
roslaunch harvester_gazebo harvester_test.launch
```
